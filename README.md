Synchronous RAM Module Design Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple Synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module that supports both read and write operations. The module will be developed using Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.

Project Objective:

Design a synchronous RAM module with clock-based control for read and write operations.

Ensure proper memory access and data storage functionality.

Develop a testbench to validate the RAM module's behavior under different scenarios.

Simulate the design to demonstrate read and write operations accurately.



---

Key Features:

1. Clock Synchronization: All operations (read and write) are synchronized with the rising edge of the clock signal.


2. Read Operation: Data from a specified address will be output when read enable (read_en) is active.


3. Write Operation: Data will be written to a specified address when write enable (write_en) is active.


4. Address Bus: The address bus will determine the memory location for read/write operations.


5. Data Bus: Facilitates data transfer during read and write processes.


6. Memory Depth and Width: The module will have configurable memory depth (number of locations) and data width (bit size of each location).




---

Deliverables:

1. HDL Code: Complete RTL code for the synchronous RAM module.


2. Testbench: A functional testbench to verify the correctness of the RAM operations.


3. Simulation Results: Evidence of successful simulation showcasing accurate read and write operations.




---

Learning Outcomes:

Understand the architecture and working of synchronous RAM.

Gain experience in designing, coding, and simulating digital memory systems.

Develop debugging and verification skills using simulation tools.


Upon successful completion of the project, participants will receive a Completion Certificate on the internship end date from CODTECH.

This project will provide practical exposure to digital design principles, preparing participants for real-world hardware development scenarios.
